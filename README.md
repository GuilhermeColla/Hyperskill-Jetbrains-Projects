# My take ont the Hyperskill Jetbains Academy python course.

Here I'll post the projects I've developed during my time in said course.
I've labled the projects in a certain way: <project_name> (difficulty).
Note that the difficulty of the code is given by the Hyperskill team, it does not reflect my personal opinion.
